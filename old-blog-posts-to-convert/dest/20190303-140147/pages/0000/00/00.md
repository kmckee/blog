My name is Kyle McKee. I'm a developer living in Cleveland, Ohio.  I started writing code as a hobby and eventually I made a career out of it.  I love what I do.

I pay the bills by working in C# and JavaScript (mostly on web stuff), but I also write a lot of code in my free time using whatever languages and technologies I can get my hands on.  I'm constantly looking for something new to learn.

# The top things I value in code are:

* Readability
* Testability
* Simplicity

# My biggest professional influences are:

* Robert Martin
* Kent Beck
* Steve Freeman & Nat Pryce

# What else?

I'm also a father, dog owner, husband, and Bob Vila wanna-be.
